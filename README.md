### What is it?

A bundle of code snippets I use with Xcode 4, converted from Xcode 3 text macros using "TextMacro2Snippet"(https://github.com/ppm/TextMacro2Snippet).

### How to Use

1. Move the contents of folder 'snippets' into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets, and relaunch the Xcode 4.

Have fun!
